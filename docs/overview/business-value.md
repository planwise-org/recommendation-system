# Business Value

## Overview

Planwise delivers concrete business value through its recommendation engine for both locals and tourists in Madrid. Every technical choice has been guided by core business goals: driving user engagement, enabling seamless growth, and laying the groundwork for future revenue opportunities.

## Key Business Components

### Putting Users First

- **Interactive Preference Sliders**: By letting users adjust broad categories—like "Art & Culture" versus "Nightlife"—we reduce decision fatigue and make recommendations feel truly personalized, boosting click-through and return rates.

- **Transparent Algorithms**: Explanations such as "Powered by Autoencoder" allow us to generate trust and encourage deeper exploration and valuable feedback, which we can later package into premium insights dashboards.

### Experimentation & Upsells

- **Multiple Recommendation Engines**: We've implemented four different models—autoencoder, SVD, madrid transfer learning and transfer-learning—so we can A/B test which one drives the most bookings or on-site conversions. This modular setup also opens the door to offering advanced algorithms as a subscription for business clients (e.g., travel agencies).

### Scalable, Cost-Effective Infrastructure

- **Containerization & Serverless**: Docker and Vercel serverless functions minimize idle costs and allow us to scale automatically during peak seasons.

- **CI/CD & MLOps**: Automated pipelines boost feature roll-outs and model updates, allowing us to reduce operational overhead as well as speed up our path to having our product be market fit.

### Data as a Strategic Asset

- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Our API captures structured user reviews that we feed directly into our analytics pipeline, allowing for constant refinement of features and recommendation quality—a critical factor for retaining both individual users and enterprise partners.

- **Segmented Experiences**: By distinguishing between frequent travelers and long-time locals, we can tailor premium experiences or targeted ads, unlocking new revenue streams.

### Ready for Partnership & Expansion

- **Modular API**: Built on FastAPI with OAuth2 and clear Swagger documentation, our service can be white-labeled by hotels, event organizers, or other partners, making integration effortless.

- **City-Agnostic Design**: Although we started with Madrid, our pipelines and models can be retrained on any city's data with minimal effort, enabling rapid rollout in new destinations.
