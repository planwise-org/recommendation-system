# Chatbot Interface

## Overview

The Planwise Chatbot Interface provides a conversational way to interact with our recommendation system. Through natural language processing, users can express their preferences, receive personalized recommendations, and explore places in Madrid without navigating through traditional UI elements.

## Features

### Natural Language Preference Extraction

- **Conversational Input**: Users can express preferences in natural language
  - Example: "I'm interested in museums and parks, but not shopping malls"
  - Example: "I love food and coffee, especially in quiet areas"
- **Contextual Understanding**: The system interprets qualifiers and modifiers
  - "Very interested in art" ‚Üí higher rating for art-related categories
  - "Not really into nightlife" ‚Üí lower rating for nightlife categories
- **Preference Refinement**: Users can adjust previously stated preferences
  - "Actually, I prefer outdoor activities more than museums"

### Recommendation Delivery

- **Formatted Results**: Recommendations are presented in a clear, conversational format
- **Explanation**: Each recommendation includes a brief explanation of why it was suggested
- **Grouping**: Related places are grouped together for easier browsing
- **Follow-up Questions**: Users can ask for more details about specific places

### Interactive Exploration

- **Location-Based Queries**: "What's good near Plaza Mayor?"
- **Category Filtering**: "Show me only parks and museums"
- **Sorting Options**: "Sort by distance" or "Show me the highest-rated first"
- **Details On Demand**: "Tell me more about the Prado Museum"

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

The chatbot is powered by our FastAPI backend with these key endpoints:

#### Preference Extraction

```
POST /api/preferences/extract-preferences
```

- **Input**: JSON with text field containing user message
- **Output**: JSON with extracted preference categories and their ratings

#### Recommendation Generation

```
POST /api/recommendations/chat
```

- **Input**: JSON with user ID, location, and preference context
- **Output**: JSON with recommended places and explanation metadata

### Natural Language Processing

Our chatbot uses a multi-stage NLP pipeline:

1. **Tokenization & POS Tagging**: Identify sentence structure and parts of speech
2. **Named Entity Recognition**: Extract location names and place references
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine attitude toward mentioned categories
4. **Category Mapping**: Link extracted concepts to our internal category system
5. **Rating Inference**: Convert qualitative statements to numerical preference ratings

### Recommendation Engine Integration

The chatbot connects to the same recommendation models as the web interface:

- **Model Selection**: Automatically chooses the most appropriate model based on user context
- **Default Ensemble**: Uses the ensemble model by default for most robust recommendations
- **Context Awareness**: Adapts to user's expressed preferences and location
